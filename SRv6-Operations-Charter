Charter

Mission:
SRv6OPS WG focuses on the operational aspects of deploying and managing Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) networks. The mission includes:
-Developing best practices and guidelines for secure, efficient, and scalable operation of SRv6 networks.
-Identifying and addressing operational challenges encountered during SRv6 deployments.
-Fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among network operators, vendors, and researchers involved in SRv6.
-Liaising with other IETF Working Groups (WGs) relevant to SRv6 and related technologies.
-Contributing to the standardization of operational tools and mechanisms for SRv6 networks.

Scope:
The scope of the SRv6 OPS WG includes, but is not limited to:
-Operational Issues and corresponding solutions: IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SIDs, protection, inter-domain.
-Security considerations: Securing control plane protocols and data plane communications, access control, and mitigation of attack vectors.
-Deployment scenarios: Addressing operational considerations for diverse network environments and use cases.
-SRv6 network management: Configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance optimization.
-Interworking operational guidance with other technologies: Seamless integration of SRv6 with existing networks and protocols, including SR MPLS.

Work Items:
The SRv6 OPS WG will work on the following items:
-SRv6 transition and coexistence strategies 
-IPv6 Address planning and management for SRv6
-SRv6 interoperation, including original and compression
-SRv6 Inter-domain
-SRv6 management procedure and tools
-SRv6 Security Practices


Relationships with Other WGs:
-SPRING WG: Close collaboration on SRv6 protocol design and operational considerations.
-v6ops WG: Sharing best practices and addressing challenges related to IPv6 and SRv6 interworking.
-6man WG: Coordination on core IPv6 functionalities and addressing their impact on SRv6 operation.
-Other relevant WGs: Cooperation on specific areas like security, management frameworks, and tools.
