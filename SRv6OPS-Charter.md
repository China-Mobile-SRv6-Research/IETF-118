# Proposed Charter for SRv6 Operations (SRv6OPS)

## Mission:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on the operational aspects of deploying and managing Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) networks. The mission includes:
* Developing best practices and guidelines for secure, efficient, and scalable operation of SRv6 networks.
* Identifying and addressing operational challenges encountered during SRv6 deployments.
* Fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among network operators, vendors, and researchers involved in SRv6 operations.
* Collaborate with other IETF Working Groups (WGs) relevant to SRv6 and related technologies.
* Provide advice on standardizing operational tools and mechanisms for SRv6 networks.

## Scope:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on best practices, deployment guidance, operational issues, new requirements, and potential operational experiments.
The development of solutions and protocol extensions is not within the scope of the SRv6OPS WG. Furthermore, the SRv6OPS WG won't consider adopting documents that discuss operational considerations and guidance for SRv6-related technologies that are still under development in other WGs (SPRING, 6MAN, for example). However, the SRv6OPS WG will welcome presentations to increase awareness to potential operational issues and seek for feedback from the operators community.

The scope of the SRv6OPS WG includes:
* Operational Issues and requirements for possible solutions: IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SIDs, protection, inter-domain, interworking with other technologies.
* Deployment scenarios: Addressing operational considerations for diverse network environments and use cases.
* SRv6 network management guidance: Configuration, observability, assurance, and performance optimization.
* The SRv6OPS WG will not adopt any work until it reaches consensus in the SPRING WG. 

## Key Deliverables:
The SRv6OPS WG will work on the following items:
* SRv6 deployment status and best practice, including deployment scenarios (including metro, core and enterprise networks), scale-up capability, and inter-domain deployment experience. 
* Recommendations and guidance for IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SID, including SRv6 compression. 
* SRv6 network management guidance for configuration, automation, observability, assurance, performance optimization, and troubleshooting.

## Relationships with Other WGs:
The SRv6OPS WG will cooperate with other WGs as needed. Specific expected interactions include (but may not be limited to):
* SPRING WG: Close cooperation on SRv6 protocol extensions, new requirements and operational considerations.
* v6ops WG: Sharing best practices and addressing IPv6 and SRv6 interworking challenges.
* 6man WG: cooperation on core IPv6 functionalities and addressing their impact on SRv6 operation.
