# Proposed Charter for SRv6 Operations (SRv6OPS)

## Mission:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on the operational aspects of deploying and managing Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) networks. The mission includes:
* Developing best practices and guidelines for secure, efficient, and scalable operation of SRv6 networks.
* Identifying and addressing operational challenges encountered during SRv6 deployments.
* Fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among network operators, vendors, and researchers involved in SRv6 operations.
* Coordinate and collaborate with other IETF Working Groups (WGs) relevant to SRv6 and related technologies.
* Contributing to the standardization of operational tools and mechanisms for SRv6 networks.

## Scope:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on best practices, deployment guidance, operational issues, new requirements, and potential operational experiments. Solutions and protocol extensions are not within its scope. The scope of the SRv6OPS WG includes:
* Operational Issues and suggested solutions: IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SIDs, protection, inter-domain.
* Security recommendations: Best practices and operational guidance in securing control plane protocols and data plane communications, access control, and mitigation of attack vectors.
* Deployment scenarios: Addressing operational considerations for diverse network environments and use cases.
* SRv6 network management guidance: Configuration, observability, assurance, and performance optimization.
* Interworking operational guidance with other technologies: Seamless integration of SRv6 with existing networks and protocols, including SR-MPLS.

## Key Deliverables:
The SRv6OPS WG will work on the following items:
* SRv6 deployment status and best practice, including deployment scenarios (including metro, core and enterprise networks), scale-up capability, and inter-domain deployment experience. 
* Recommendations and guidance for IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SID, including SRv6 compression. 
* SRv6 network management guidance for configuration, automation, observability, assurance, performance optimization, and troubleshooting.
* SRv6 Security recommendations: Potential threats, best practice, and potential new requirements.

## Relationships with Other WGs:
The SRv6OPS WG will coordinate and collaborate with other WGs as needed. Specific expected interactions include (but may not be limited to):
* SPRING WG: Close collaboration on SRv6 protocol extensions, new requirements and operational considerations.
* v6ops WG: Sharing best practices and addressing IPv6 and SRv6 interworking challenges.
* 6man WG: Coordination on core IPv6 functionalities and addressing their impact on SRv6 operation.
