# Proposed Charter for SRv6 Operations (SRv6OPS)

## Mission:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on the operational aspects of deploying and managing Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) networks. The mission includes:
* Developing best practices and guidelines for secure, efficient, and scalable operation of SRv6 networks.
* Identifying and addressing operational challenges encountered during SRv6 deployments.
* Fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among network operators, vendors, and researchers involved in SRv6.
* Liaising with other IETF Working Groups (WGs) relevant to SRv6 and related technologies.
* Contributing to the standardization of operational tools and mechanisms for SRv6 networks.

## Scope:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on best practices, deployment guidance, and operational issues. Solutions and protocol extensions are not within its scope. The scope of the SRv6OPS WG includes, but is not limited to:
* Operational Issues and corresponding solutions: IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SIDs, protection, inter-domain.
* Security considerations: Securing control plane protocols and data plane communications, access control, and mitigation of attack vectors.
* Deployment scenarios: Addressing operational considerations for diverse network environments and use cases.
* SRv6 network management: Configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance optimization.
* Interworking operational guidance with other technologies: Seamless integration of SRv6 with existing networks and protocols, including SR MPLS.

## Key Deliverables:
The SRv6OPS WG will work on the following items:
* SRv6 deployment status and best practice, including deployment scenarios (including metro, core and enterprise networks), scale-up capability, inter-domain practice and so on. 
* IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SID, especially IPv6 address planning for SRv6 compression. Factors to consider include: IPv6 infrastructure consistence, minimal consumption, flexibility and so on.
* SRv6 network configuration and operations, including: information model for configuration, automation, monitoring and troubleshooting.
* SRv6 Security: Potential threats and best practice.


## Relationships with Other WGs:
* SPRING WG: Close collaboration on SRv6 protocol design and operational considerations.
* v6ops WG: Sharing best practices and addressing challenges related to IPv6 and SRv6 interworking.
* 6man WG: Coordination on core IPv6 functionalities and addressing their impact on SRv6 operation.
* Other relevant WGs: Cooperation on specific areas like security, management frameworks, and tools.
