# Proposed Charter for SRv6 Operations (SRv6OPS)

The Segment Routing (SR) instantiation on the IPv6 data plane is referred to as SRv6.

## Mission:
The SRv6OPS WG focuses on the operational aspects of deploying and managing Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) networks. The mission includes:
* Soliciting input from network operators to identify operational issues in SRv6 networks.
* Developing best practices and operational guidelines for secure, reliable, efficient, and scalable operation of SRv6 networks.
* Identifying and addressing operational challenges encountered during SRv6 deployments.

## Scope:

The SRv6OPS WG focuses on best practices, deployment guidance, operational issues, gaps, and potential operational experiments.

The development of protocols and protocol extensions is not within the scope of the SRv6OPS WG. Furthermore, the chairs of SRv6OPS WG will discuss with the AD before adopting documents that discuss operational considerations and guidance for SRv6-related technologies that are still under development in other WGs (SPRING, 6MAN, for example). Discussions and presentations to increase awareness about potential operational issues for feedback from the operator's community are welcome.

The scope of the SRv6OPS WG includes:
* Operational issues and requirements for possible solutions: IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SIDs, protection, inter-domain, interworking with other technologies.
* Deployment scenarios: Addressing operational considerations for diverse network environments and use cases.
* SRv6 network management guidance: Configuration, observability, assurance, and performance optimization.

## Key Deliverables:
The SRv6OPS WG will work on the following items:
* SRv6 deployment experience and best practices, including deployment scenarios (metro, core and enterprise networks), scale-up capability, and inter-domain implementations. 
* Recommendations and guidance for IPv6 address planning for SRv6 SID, including SRv6 compression. 
* SRv6 network management guidance for configuration, automation, and performance optimization.
* SRv6 network observability guidance for assurance and troubleshooting.

## Relationships with Other WGs:
The SRv6OPS WG will cooperate with other WGs as needed. Specific expected interactions include (but may not be limited to):
* SPRING WG: Close cooperation on SRv6 protocol extensions, new requirements and operational considerations.
* v6ops WG: Sharing best practices and addressing deployment challenges.
* 6man WG: Cooperation on core IPv6 functionalities, requirements, and operational considerations.
The chairs will cross-post WGLC notices to the relevant WGs.
